              <h5 class="card-title">When does the band class meet?</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Beginning band meets as a regular class for 46 minutes at different times throughout
                the school day for the entire school year. Students are grouped into classes according to what
                instrument they play. The teacher-pupil ratio is kept low to facilitate individual supervision of
                students’ progress. Skills develop slowly at first, therefore, students and parents must be patient and
                committed for the entire school year in order to get the full benefit of band instruction.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">What instruments are started?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Beginners are started on flute, oboe, bassoon, clarinet, alto saxophone, trumpet,
              French horn, trombone,
              baritone, tuba, and percussion. We will help you choose the instrument that is best for you at our “Try

            <h5 class="card-title">Is any previous musical training necessary?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">No. The method books used in beginner band are for the musically untrained student. We
              teach the fundamentals
              of reading music as well as the fundamentals of playing an instrument. As students progress, you will be
              able
              to recognize familiar tunes. Their progress culminates in a Spring Concert at the end of the year.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Can my child be successful even if I don’t have musical talent?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Music psychologists have tried for many years to determine whether heredity or
              environment has the greatest
              influence on musicality. Interestingly, both sides use the same data to support their arguments. The most
              important requirement for success is the desire to succeed.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Are certain instruments for girls and others for boys?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Definitely NOT! Instrument choices are not based on a student’s gender, but rather
              their desire to play that
              instrument. Instrument selection is based primarily upon the facial characteristics of the student, and,
              most
              importantly, their personal choice.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Instruments will be needed on the first day of school. Locked storage for all
              instruments is provided in the
              band hall. Please make sure that the case is labeled with your child’s name. Don’t wait too long! Most
              music
              companies run out of stock in July AND raise their prices to take advantage of late renters/buyers! We
              will
              have a music company attend our instrument selection meeting for you to reserve an instrument for the
              fall.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Should I rent or purchase an instrument?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">RENT! Renting an instrument will give your child the opportunity to begin in band with
              only a small initial
              investment. Your child can have the advantages of a brand new instrument, such as pride of ownership,
              freedom
              from error due to poor equipment, and the opportunity to be the best player they can be by having the best
              available instrument for their age level. The music company will have the instrument and mouthpiece that
              we
              recommended. The instrument can be returned to the company at any time without further obligation. All
              rent
              applies towards purchase.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">What about buying used instruments?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Some used instruments are good bargains. However, you could possibly end up spending
              more money on repairs
              than the instrument is worth. For this reason, we ask that if you do purchase a used instrument, try to
              let a
              F.I.S.D. Band Director examine it prior to purchase. Local music stores and former band students are
              excellent
              sources of used instruments. You might see if the music companies have used instruments available. We have
              found most pawn shop instruments to be of dubious quality. WARNING: The “band instruments” listed in
              departments store (i.e. Sears, Sam’s), in my personal opinion, are JUNK! They are practically toys. The
              Nelson
              Band program will not allow any Sam’s Club, Sears, or Walmart instruments. Again, we recommend that you
              RENT
              an instrument the first year from a reputable music company.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Are there any school owned instruments available?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Yes. The school provides the more expensive instruments: tuba, baritone, French horn,
              oboe, and bassoon.
              These are assigned on the basis of aptitude, suitability, and availability – NOT financial need. Parents
              whose
              child is selected to play one of these school instruments are required to pay a $50 per Semester usage
              fee,
              and will still be required to purchase necessary accessories such as a mouthpiece, books, reeds/valve oil.
              Due
              to the unique nature and difficulty of the oboe, bassoon, French horn, it is required that they take
              weekly
              private lessons (See #15). These instruments are so challenging that if you don’t take lessons, you should
              not
              even elect to play them. Private lessons for all instruments are strongly encouraged.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Can my child start playing as soon as he/she gets an instrument?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">In order to prevent costly repairs and the formation of bad habits, we prefer that the
              instrument stay in the
              case during the summer. Instruments will stay in the storage room of the band hall during the first week
              of
              school. After formal instruction is given on the care and assembly of the instrument during the first week
              of
              school, your child will begin taking the instrument home. This is to protect your investment! If you
              rent/purchase from a music company, the store will deliver the instrument and materials to our band hall
              before the first day of school. An additional option for eager students is to start band this SUMMER with
              a
              Private Lesson teacher (See # 15). This is a chance to get one-on-one help and be set-up for success with
              one
              of the professional musicians who teach on our campus each week. The teachers understand that some lessons
              might have to be rescheduled due to family vacations.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Can my child participate in both athletics and band at the same time?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Band and choir? Band and Orchestra? Band & Theatre Arts? In 7th and 8th grade YES, but
              NOT in 6th grade.
              Athletics is not offered in the 6th grade. There is only ONE elective in 6th grade and students must
              choose
              between either Band, Choir, Orchestra, Art, or Theatre Arts. In 7th & 8th grade students may take more
              electives than they can in 6th grade. There are many middle school students who are in band, athletics,
              and
              other organizations such as theatre arts, choir, etc. Because of the unique nature of playing a musical
              instrument, we try to encourage students to begin band in 6th grade and then take other electives along
              with
              band in their 7th & 8th grade years. If you want your child to learn a band instrument, you will need to
              put
              band as your FIRST CHOICE for an elective. Students choosing band as their elective SECOND choice will NOT
              be
              placed into BAND. In 7th grade & 8th grade, the school administration, coaches, classroom teachers and
              band
              directors work together to try to avoid conflicts in scheduling. We have current Nelson MS Band members
              who
              are also in 7th & 8th grade football, volleyball, basketball, tennis, cross country, Student Coucil, NJHS,
              cheerleading, and in school theater productions!</p>

              mini-concert in the fall to
              demonstrate progress, a Winter concert, a Music Festival in May (during school), a solo contest in May ,

            <h5 class="card-title">Will my child be required to practice at home?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Yes. Beginning the second week of school, students are required as a part of their
              grade to practice 15-30
              minutes every day outside of class. They record their time on a “Practice Card”, which is turned in and
              graded
              weekly. For home practice, students are to purchase a folding music stand, metronome (electronic
              time-keeper).
              We have found that these items are important in carrying the classroom experiences over to home practice.
              Parents are encouraged to give positive support to the student as he/she progresses. All instruments are
              required to be taken home every day even if they cannot practice that evening.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Although your band directors stress academic success in all subjects, grades do not
              effect participation in
              beginner band. When going on to the 7th & 8th grade bands (and the high school band), students will be
              competing in both individual and group competitions. Students are required by state law to be passing in
              all
              subjects before being allowed to compete. (House Bill 72 – “No Pass, No Play”). Grades do not, however,
              effect
              the daily participation and membership in band, or participation in the concerts. It only effects
              competitions.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Private lessons are strongly encouraged for all students, but are not required for most
              instruments. If your child takes private lessons, he/she will receive one-on-one instruction from a
              professional musician (most of
              which have graduate degrees). Lessons are held once a week at Nelson Middle School (supervised by a band
              director) at a cost of $18 per half hour. Private lessons help challenge faster-paced students and
              strengthen slower paced students. Again, they are not required, but above average results are almost
              guaranteed! It is
              better to RENT a less expensive instrument and participate in the private lessons program than to purchase
              a
              top line instrument and not take lessons!! Lessons are important!</p>
